          <h2><span>Bloody Sunday: Bitcoin, others fall sharply after record highs</span></h2>
          <img id="img-news" src="images/bitcoin.jpg" alt="Bitcoinde düşüş" />
          <p style="font-family:'Spectral',serif;">
            The cryptocurrency market’s flagship coin, Bitcoin, plunged as much as 15.1% to $51,707.51 on Sunday, the
            most
            in
            more than seven weeks and just days after it reached a new record.

            The biggest cryptocurrency around the world, it fell 8.5% to $55,810.32 as of 2:52 p.m. in Singapore, after
            declining 15.1%.

            The second-largest coin on the market, Ethereum, also dropped almost 18% before paring losses.

            The fall came amid speculations about the U.S. Treasury may crackdown on money laundering that’s carried out
            through
            digital assets.

            Last week, Bitcoin hit a new record of $64,869.78 on April 14, extending its 2021 rally to new heights. It
            is
            valued
            at more than $1 trillion on over 800% surge in the past year.

            Growing mainstream acceptance as an investment and a means of payment sent Bitcoin to record highs, along
            with
            investors’ seeking high-yielding assets amid low-interest rates.

            Major firms including BNY Mellon, Mastercard Inc. and Tesla Inc. are among those to have embraced or
            invested in
            cryptocurrencies.

            The electric-car maker had in February said it bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin and would soon accept it as a
            form
            of
            payment for cars, sending the price of the world's most popular cryptocurrency soaring.

            Then on March 24, Elon Musk said that people can buy his company's electric vehicles using bitcoin and the
            option
            will also be available outside the United States later this year.

            Wall Street firms like Morgan Stanley also began providing access to the tokens to some of the wealthiest
            clients.

            According to Richard Byworth, CEO of Diginex, a Nasdaq-listed digital asset financial services company, the
            price
            of
            the world’s most popular cryptocurrency could reach as much as $175,000 before the end of the year.

            Government concerns
            Meanwhile, governments are inspecting risks around the sector, while the investor base widens as concerns
            still
            linger regarding the sector due to its high volatility. For example, Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency created as a
            joke
            and which has been boosted by Tesla boss Elon Musk, rallied more than 110% Friday before dropping the next
            day.

            U.S. Federal Reserve Chairperson Jerome Powell last week said Bitcoin “is a little bit like gold” in that
            it’s
            more
            a vehicle for speculation than making payments.

            Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), in January, said Bitcoin has been enabling
            “funny
            business.”

            Most recently on Friday, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) banned the use of
            cryptocurrencies as
            a
            form of payment starting April 30, saying the level of anonymity behind the digital coins brings the risk of
            “irrevocable” damage and significant transaction risks.

            The CBRT said cryptocurrencies and other such digital assets based on distributed ledger technology could
            not be
            used, directly or indirectly, as an instrument of payment.

            The move also prohibits companies that handle payments and electronic fund transfers from processing
            transactions
            involving cryptocurrency platforms.

            A lack of regulation, supervision mechanisms or central regulatory authority, combined with the potential
            for
            criminal activity and the high volatility of their market value mean digital tokens entail “significant
            risks,”
            the
            central bank said in a statement.

            Last week, Royal Motors, which distributes Rolls-Royce and Lotus cars in Turkey, became the first in the
            country
            to
            say it would accept payments in cryptocurrencies.

            The Turkish government in March said it “shares global concerns” about cryptocurrencies and that the
            developments
            were being closely followed.

            India is also expected to propose a law that bans cryptocurrencies and fines anyone trading or holding such
            assets,
            according to a Reuters report in March, citing an unidentified senior government official with direct
            knowledge
            of
            the plan.

            United Kingdom financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), also issuing a statement for the
            investors, warning the public.

            “The FCA is aware that some firms are offering investments in crypto assets or lending or investments linked
            to
            crypto assets, that promise high returns.

            “Investing in crypto assets, or investments and lending linked to them, generally involves taking very high
            risks
            with investors’ money. If consumers invest in these types of products, they should be prepared to lose all
            their
            money,” said the FCA.

            On Sunday, about 1,018,638 investors in the crypto market had their accounts worth about $10 billion
            liquidated
            amid
            the sudden drop seen in the number of altcoin assets.

      <h2><span>Turkey exceeds 20 million jabs in coronavirus vaccination drive</span></h2>
      <img id="img-news1" src="images/3.jpg"
        alt="People wearing protective masks walk on a street in the capital Ankara, Turkey, April 16, 2021. (AP PHOTO)" />
      <p style="font-family:'Spectral',serif;">
        In almost four months, Turkey managed to deliver more than 20 million jabs against the coronavirus to the
        public, as the country seeks to stave off a new wave of the pandemic. The country also started vaccinating
        people at the age of 55 and above on Monday
        As the daily number of COVID-19 cases climbs in Turkey, so do the number of vaccinations. Since Jan. 14, when
        the vaccination campaign for health care workers began, 20.1 million doses of the vaccine have been
        administered, mainly to health care workers, the elderly and people in priority groups, such as teachers.
        Health Minister Fahrettin Koca announced on Monday that people aged 55 and above were now eligible for
        inoculation.

        Health Ministry data published Monday showed that more than 12.2 million people to date have received their
        first doses, while second doses have been given to over 7.79 million, according to the data. In the commercial
        hub Istanbul, home to nearly one-fifth of Turkey's population, over 3.17 million COVID-19 vaccine jabs were
        administered, including more than 1.97 million first doses and 1.2 million second doses. Following Istanbul,
        the capital Ankara received more than 1.59 million jabs. On Jan. 14, Turkey began a mass COVID-19 vaccination
        campaign, starting with health care workers, and top officials to encourage public confidence in the vaccines.

        “We primarily tried to protect our elderly and citizens with chronic illnesses. Our vaccination program will
        continue despite all the challenges,” Minister Koca tweeted Monday.

        The government first sourced CoronaVac, developed by China’s Sinovac, for vaccination and recently added
        Pfizer-BioNTech's Comirnaty, to its inventory of vaccines. Bureaucratic hurdles and an international race to
        access vaccines sometimes slow down the vaccination drive, though Turkey managed to reach the sixth spot in
        the world, among countries with the highest vaccination rates.

        Optimistic projections of the Health Ministry indicate that people at the age of 40 and above will be
        vaccinated by June. Speaking last week after a meeting of the Health Ministry’s Coronavirus Scientific
        Advisory Board, Koca said Turkey would receive an additional shipment of at least 30 million doses of
        Comirnaty in June.

        The vaccination drive also brought vaccine skeptics and anti-vaxxers out of the woodwork, with fringe groups
        thriving on social media. Though complex conspiracy theories still find followers online in Turkey, surveys
        show the majority of people are inclined to be vaccinated.

        A survey conducted by professor Veysel Bozkurt, a member of the Social Sciences Board of the Health Ministry,
        shows that 91% of society are willing to be vaccinated. Most of them are “pensioners and people living in big
        cities,” according to the survey, while homemakers and students make up the majority of the vaccine opponents.

        Results of the survey published by the Sabah newspaper show that vaccine proponents were mostly those who have
        severely suffered from COVID-19. The survey, conducted with more than 4,000 people across the country, shows
        that vaccine skepticism flourished in parallel with economic, existential concerns and belief in conspiracy
        theories, and decreased in line with increased faith in the state, science and scientists, depending on
        education level, age and income. Women were more skeptical than men, the survey found.

        In the face of rising cases and fatality numbers, Turkey announced the return of weekend curfews in high-risk
        areas, as well as other restrictions, in addition to special measures for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

        Since December 2019, the pandemic has claimed over 3 million lives in 192 countries and regions, according to
        figures compiled by the United States' Johns Hopkins University. Over 141.4 million cases have been reported
        worldwide, with recoveries now at over 80.77 million.

        Turkey's COVID-19 deaths have risen four-fold over the past month, with the number of patients in critical
        condition doubling over the period, according to a tally of Health Ministry data, based on figures between
        March 18 and April 18.

        In February, when coronavirus restrictions including lockdowns were still in place, 129 fatalities were
        recorded on the first day of the month, with deaths dropping to 66 on the last day of the month. As
        restrictions were relaxed in March, a spike in fatalities was reported. On March 1, 69 people died and this
        figure rose to 81 on March 18. On March 21, the fatalities reached three digits with 102 people losing the
        battle against the virus. The figures kept rising throughout the month with the virus claiming 152 lives on
        March 31. The upward trend continued in April as well. The Health Ministry reported 176 fatalities on April 1,
        with deaths reaching 211 on April 6. Some 318 people died on April 18 due to the coronavirus, thus raising the
        month-on-month death toll four times.

        The number of patients in critical condition also saw a month-on-month rise. It was reported that the number
        of COVID-19 patients in critical condition was 1,615 on Feb. 1. This figure dropped to 1,232 in mid-February,
        and further declined to 1,191 on Feb. 28. At the beginning of March, the number of patients in critical
        condition saw a surge. The number of seriously ill patients receiving COVID-19 treatment rose to 1,215 on
        March 1, 1,425 on March 15, and 1,503 on March 18. The number of patients in critical condition exceeded the
        2,000-band on the last day of the month, hitting 2,054. In the first week of April, the number of seriously
        ill patients rose to 2,604. At the end of the second week of April, the figure reached 3,018.

        This trend continued in the last three days as well, with 3,205 patients on April 16, 3,240 on April 17 and
        3,275 on April 18. The figure on April 18 doubled in comparison to the same date of the previous month.

        Turkey brought back most restrictions after the March normalization but a map by Health Ministry shows that
        the country took a sharp turn for the worse in the number of cases. The map covering a period between April 10
        and April 16, indicates that weekly cases increased in 75 out of the 81 provinces of the country. Provinces
        with highest rises were Düzce, Çanakkale, Zonguldak, Yozgat and Yalova. Those that reported the least rise in
        cases were Gümüşhane, Artvin, Siirt, Kahramanmaraş and Edirne.

        The western province of Çanakkale has the highest number of weekly cases per 100,000 people, at around 962. It
        is followed by Istanbul at 920 and Yalova, at 838. Provinces in the Black Sea region, which had the highest
        number of weekly cases for long, reported progress, though, weekly case numbers fluctuate between 500 and 600
        there, including Samsun where the number of cases per 100,000 was at 601.

        All provinces with a low number of cases are located in southeastern and eastern Turkey. Şırnak, with around
        47 cases, has been holding the title of the province with the least number of cases per 100,000 people, since
        March.
