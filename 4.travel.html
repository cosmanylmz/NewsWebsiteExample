        <h2><span>Air traffic suspension to Turkey hits Russia's tourism sector</span></h2>

          alt="Air traffic suspension to Turkey hits Russia's tourism sector">
        <p>Russia's tourism sector, hit by Kremlin’s decision to halt charter flights to Turkey, is keenly awaiting the
          resumption of travel to and from Turkey by June 1.

          Moscow has said it was suspending most air travel with Turkey, a popular destination for millions of Russian
          tourists, citing rising coronavirus infections in a move that comes amid growing political tensions over
          Ankara’s support for Ukraine.

          Most charter and regular flights to and from Turkey will be restricted from April 15 to June 1, Russian Deputy
          Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova said Monday.

          Yet, two flights per week will continue between Moscow and Istanbul, Golikova told a televised briefing.

          Yuri Barzykin, vice president of the Russian Union of Travel Industry, said Russian companies stand to lose
          around 5 billion rubles ($65 million) due to the air traffic halt.

          "We hope to be compensated for these losses. We also expect the government to initiate a subsidy program for
          airlines and tour operators," he told Russian news agency TASS.

          Flights to take home Russian nationals working on the Akkuyu nuclear power plant project in Turkey's southern
          province of Mersin will also continue, she told a news conference on Monday.

          Around 530,000 Russians had booked tours to Turkey, according to the Russian Association of Tour Operators
          (ATOR), which said the tourism industry could take a hit of more than $422 million from the canceled flight
          bookings alone.

          The decision to drastically cut the number of flights to Turkey, which is heavily reliant on revenue from
          tourism, was announced two days after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan met with Ukrainian President
          Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Istanbul.

        <p>Turkey's partial lockdown decision during the holy month of Ramadan amid rising COVID-19 cases in the country
          was the correct decision in terms of contributing to tourism, Turkish tourism professionals said Wednesday.
          Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Tuesday announced that the government will have imposed a two-week
          partial lockdown as of April 14 to help curb a recent rise in coronavirus cases.
          The tourism professionals, who expect 30 million tourists this year thanks to Turkey's Safe Tourism
          Certification Program, welcomed the government's decision.

          Mehmet İşler, the President of Aegean Touristic Enterprises and Accommodation Union, said the latest
          coronavirus measures of the government will be beneficial to reduce the number of COVID-19 cases for the
          summer tourism season.

          “We believe that the (tourism) season will be good thanks to strict measures. And Turkey deservedly will be
          ahead of its competitors in the European (tourism) market,” he said.

          Stressing that the latest measures were on point, İşler said Turkey will overcome the pandemic.

          “These measures are extremely right. As a society, we will overcome these (bad) days by taking responsibility
          together and we will host tourists in our country in 2021. Thanks to the tourism sector, foreign currencies
          and employment will be provided. Most importantly, we believe that we will reach our goal of 30 million
          tourists,” he said.

          Turkey started a vaccination campaign for tourism workers. The campaign includes employees of airlines,
          airports, accommodation facilities and travel agencies, as well as tourist guides.

          According to the country's Tourism Promotion and Development Agency, the vaccination process for tourism
          workers will be completed before the summer season.

          Under the new restrictions, the weekday curfew will start at 7 p.m. instead of 9 p.m. and last until 5 a.m.,
          during which inter-city travel will also be banned except for necessary and urgent situations.

          Cafes, restaurants and teahouses will also only provide home delivery and takeaway services, while wedding
          halls, sports centers and game halls will be closed until the end of the Eid holiday marking the end of
          Ramadan in the country.

          Erdoğan said restrictions on public transportation for people over 65 and under 18 would be in effect again.

          According to the government, with its stricter measures during Ramadan's first two weeks, Turkey aims to
          significantly reduce the number of cases and deaths related to COVID-19.</p>
