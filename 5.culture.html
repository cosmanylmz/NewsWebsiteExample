          <span>World's largest iceberg A68 melts away</span>
          <img class="img-culture" src="images/109004.jpg" alt="World's largest iceberg A68 melts away">
          <p>One of the largest icebergs ever recorded, A68, apparently, is not that big anymore.
    
            The iceberg, codenamed A68, had broken off Antarctica sometime between July 10 and July 12 in 2017. Scientists
            who monitored the trillion-ton ice cube said it was larger than the U.S. state of Delaware.
    
            A68 had an area of 5,800-square kilometers (2,200-square miles) and was about 350 meters (1,100 feet) thick.
    
            However, satellites show the iceberg has now virtually gone, broken into countless small fragments that the U.S.
            National Ice Center says are no longer worth tracking.
    
            The giant iceberg almost did not move for a year after it broke off, but then it started to drift north with
            increasing speed, riding on strong currents and winds. It then spun out into the
            South Atlantic towards the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia. By the time, the waves, higher air
            temperatures and the warm water cause the mammoth to melt.</p>

          <span>2 young Turkish pianists win Romanian International music fest</span>
          <img class="img-culture1" src="images/piano.jpg" alt="İrfan Karakılıç poses near his piano. (AA Photo)">
          <p>Two Turkish pianists, 11-year-old Nisan Öksüz and 10-year-old Irfan Karakılıç, won their categories at the
            third International
            Online "Rezonante Sonore Festival" of Romania.
            Attending Yaşar University's online music academy during the coronavirus pandemic, Öksüz and Karakılıç
            were rewarded for their work with this win, according to the university.

          <p>The competition was held online April 8-10 with 120 competitors of different ages from Turkey, Romania,
            Portugal, Spain, France, Hungary and Moldova. Öksüz and Karakılıç participated in the contest with videos in
            which they recorded their performances.
            Öksüz captivated listeners with the works of Carl Czerny and Calude Debussy, while Karakılıç played stunning
            renditions of Johann Sebastian Bach and Franz Schubert.
            The international jury members gave first prizes to Nisan and to Irfan in line with their age groups.</p>
